# Manipulating Geospatial Data with Python

## Description

The code samples and data in this repository were created while learning the concepts inside of *Python for Geographic Data Analysis* by Henrikki Tenkanen, Vuokko Heikinheimo, David Whipp. My code does not correspond with the exercises or other materials from the book, as I tried to create original exercises to practice with. Here is the description for the first script I wrote, as an example.

```python
# kumpula.py - 06/09/2025. Practicing concepts from Part I, Section 3.
# Imports Kumpula's weather data from a CSV file, normalizes the dates,
# saves that data to another CSV file, and shows stats about the data.
```

## Directory Hierarchy

The **src** directory contains all of my source code, and the **data** directory contains all sample datasets used by my source code. Scripts in the **src** directory must be executed with the root of this repository as the present working directory, as shown below.

```bash
$> python ./src/kumpula.py
```
